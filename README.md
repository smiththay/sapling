## Introduction
An online social budgeting web application. The pandemic revealed a big flaw in how people are unprepared for financial hardship. The topic of money is taboo which makes it difficult to learn how to properly save and budget. By creating an environment that encourages each other to save, I believe people will have better money habits. In this web application,  you  will  be able to post progress of things youâ€™re saving for (car, down payment for house, tuition etc.) to a community page and other users of the app can comment and like the post to encourage you to achieve your goal. Take your money from a sapling to a well rooted tree.
